                    <p>As a beginner in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), training 2-3 times per week is ideal.
                        This frequency allows you to progress steadily while giving your body time to recover and adapt to the physical demands of the sport.

                    <p><span>Why 2–3 Times Per Week?</span></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning and Retention: Attending regularly but not excessively helps you absorb techniques and reinforce them through repetition.
                        </li>
                        <li>Avoiding Burnout: Starting too aggressively can lead to physical and mental fatigue or even injury.
                        </li>
                        <li>Building Strength and Endurance: Your body needs time to adapt to the specific movements and intensity of BJJ.
                        </li>
                        <li>Developing Consistency: Building a habit of consistent training is more important than overloading at the start.

                    </ul>
                    <p>Gradually increase frequency as your body and skill level improve, you can consider training more often (e.g., 4–5 times per week). Always listen to your body and prioritize rest if you feel overly sore or fatigued.
